# ESP-Multiple-Frameworks
Playin' around with the ESP8266 outside the Tarduino ecosystem...

& messin' about with multiple source directories...

I will freely admit that the actual source code in this repo sucks.  (OTOH...  It's just sample code snagged off the Interwebs...)

Current test hardware:  Generic D1-mini clone

## Question(s)
In the ESP SDK versions, there is a function called `user_rf_cal_sector_set()`

It seems they are nearly, but not quite the same in nonOS & RTOS...

Why?

Also, is there documentation anywhere that actually explains them?

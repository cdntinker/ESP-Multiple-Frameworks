# ESP-Multiple-Frameworks
Playin' around with the ESP8266 outside the Tarduino ecosystem...

& messin' about with multiple source directories...

I will freely admit that the actual source code in this repo sucks.  (OTOH...  It's just sample code snagged off the Interwebs...)

Current test hardware:  Generic D1-mini clone
